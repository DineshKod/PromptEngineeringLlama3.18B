Output your answer like this: \#\#\#work: <work> \#\#\# Answer: <answer>","To solve this problem, we need to find the scale factor between the two quadrilaterals and then apply that scale factor to the perimeter of Quadrilateral A.

First, let's find the scale factor. We know that the shortest side of Quadrilateral B is 2, and the shortest side of Quadrilateral A is 6. Therefore, the scale factor is:

Scale factor = (shortest side of Quadrilateral B) / (shortest side of Quadrilateral A) = 2 / 6 = 1/3

Now, we need to apply this scale factor to the side lengths of Quadrilateral A to find the side lengths of Quadrilateral B. We do this by dividing each side length of Quadrilateral A by the scale factor:

Side lengths of Quadrilateral B = (side lengths of Quadrilateral A) / scale factor
Side lengths of Quadrilateral B = (6, 9, 9, 12) / (1/3)

Side lengths of Quadrilateral B = (6 * 3, 9 * 3, 9 * 3, 12 * 3) = (18, 27, 27, 36)

Finally, we need to find the perimeter of Quadrilateral B by adding up the side lengths:

Perimeter of Quadrilateral B = 18 + 27 + 27 + 36 = 108

So the perimeter of Quadrilateral B is 108.

We want to find x, so we'll solve for x:

35,814 = -4x

To isolate x, we'll divide both sides by -4:

x = 35,814 / -4

x = -8,953.5

Since time cannot be negative, we'll take the absolute value of x:

x = 8,953.5

So it would take approximately 8,953.5 seconds for DeepSea Challenger to reach the bottom of Challenger Deep.

Output your answer like this: \#\#\#work: <work> \#\#\# Answer: <answer>","To solve this problem, we can set up an equation using the formula for a linear function:

y = mx + b

where y represents the temperature decrease, m represents the rate of decrease (0.8 degrees Celsius per hour), x represents the number of hours, and b represents the starting temperature (noon, which we can assume as 0 since we are only interested in the change).

We are given that the temperature decreased by 4.4 degrees Celsius, so we can plug in the values:

4.4 = 0.8x

Now, we can solve for x (the number of hours) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.8:

x = 4.4 / 0.8
x = 5.5

So, it took 5.5 hours for the temperature to decrease by 4.4 degrees Celsius.

By how much will they mark up the price of the vehicle? Do not include units ($) in your answer. Show all work. Output your answer like this: \#\#\#work: <work> \#\#\# Answer: <answer>","To calculate the markup, we first need to determine the amount of profit the dealership wants to make. We can do this by multiplying the wholesale price by the desired profit percentage:

Profit = Wholesale Price × Desired Profit Percentage
Profit = $12,000 × 32%
Profit = $12,000 × 0.32
Profit = $3,840

Now that we know the desired profit, we can calculate the markup by adding this profit to the wholesale price:

Markup = Wholesale Price + Profit
Markup = $12,000 + $3,840
Markup = $15,840

To find the markup percentage, we can divide the markup by the wholesale price and multiply by 100:

Markup Percentage = (Markup / Wholesale Price) × 100
Markup Percentage = ($15,840 / $12,000) × 100
Markup Percentage = 1.32 × 100
Markup Percentage = 132%

So the car dealership will mark up the price of the vehicle by 132%. Here is the work in the specified format:

\#\#\#work: Profit = $12,000 × 0.32 = $3,840

To find the maximum percent error for the total length of the floor, we need to find the maximum error in measuring the total length L. Since the boards are laid end to end, the total length is the sum of the lengths of the individual boards.

Output your answer like this: \#\#\#work: <work> \#\#\# Answer: <answer>","To find the width of the lake on the scale drawing, we can set up a proportion using the given scale and actual width of the lake.

Let x be the width of the lake on the scale drawing in centimeters.

Scale: 1 cm : 80 m
Actual width: 1,000 m

We can set up the proportion as follows:

1 cm / 80 m = x cm / 1,000 m

Now, we can cross-multiply and solve for x:

1 * 1,000 = 80 * x
1,000 = 80x

Now, divide both sides by 80:

x = 1,000 / 80
x = 12.5

So, the width of the lake on the scale drawing is 12.5 cm.

Output your answer like this: \#\#\#work: <work> \#\#\# Answer: <answer>,"#\#\#work: To solve the equation x - (-6) = -2, we'll first simplify the equation by removing the negative sign in front of -6. The equation becomes x + 6 = -2. Next, we'll isolate x by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation. This gives us x = -2 - 6. Finally, we'll simplify the right side of the equation to find the value of x. This gives us x = -8. So, the solution to the equation is x = -8.
