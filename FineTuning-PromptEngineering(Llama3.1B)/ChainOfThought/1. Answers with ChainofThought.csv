Quadrilateral B is a scaled copy of Quadrilateral A, with its shortest side of length 2. What is the perimeter of Quadrilateral B? Show all work. Output your answer like this: \#\#\#work: <work> \#\#\# Answer: <answer>","To find the perimeter of Quadrilateral B, we first need to determine the scale factor used to create the scaled copy. Since the shortest side of Quadrilateral B is 2, and the shortest side of Quadrilateral A is 6, the scale factor is 2/6 = 1/3.

Now we can apply this scale factor to each side length of Quadrilateral A to find the corresponding side lengths of Quadrilateral B:

- Side 1 (6) * (1/3) = 2
- Side 2 (9) * (1/3) = 3
- Side 3 (9) * (1/3) = 3
- Side 4 (12) * (1/3) = 4

Now we can add up the side lengths of Quadrilateral B to find its perimeter:

Perimeter = 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 12

So, the perimeter of Quadrilateral B is 12.

#\#\#work: To find the perimeter of Quadrilateral B, we first determined the scale factor used to create the scaled copy, which is 1/3.

Output your answer like this: \#\#\#work: <work> \#\#\# Answer: <answer>","To solve this problem, we can use the concept of percentages. If the bakery used 30% more sugar this month than last month, we can find the amount of sugar used this month by increasing the amount used last month by 30%.

First, let's find 30% of the sugar used last month:

30% of 560 kg = (30/100) * 560 = 0.3 * 560 = 168 kg

Now, let's add this amount to the sugar used last month to find the amount used this month:

560 kg + 168 kg = 728 kg

So, the bakery used 728 kilograms of sugar this month. The answer is:

#\#\#work: 30% of 560 kg = (30/100) * 560 = 0.3 * 560 = 168 kg

We are given the temperature change (-4.4 degrees Celsius) and the rate (-0.8 degrees Celsius per hour). We want to find the time (in hours) it took for the temperature to decrease by 4.4 degrees Celsius.

Let's plug in the values:

\[

Output your answer like this: \#\#\#work: <work> \#\#\# Answer: <answer>","To find out how much money will be in the account after one year, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r)^n

where:
A = the amount of money in the account after one year
P = the initial amount of money in the account ($100)
r = the annual interest rate (0.06)
n = the number of years (1)

Plugging in the values, we get:

A = 100(1 + 0.06)^1

A = 100(1.06)

A = 106

Output your answer like this: \#\#\#work: <work> \#\#\# Answer: <answer>","To find the width of the lake on the scale drawing, we can use the following proportion:

1 cm / 80 m = x cm / 1,000 m

Now, we can cross-multiply and solve for x:

1 * 1,000 = 80 * x
1,000 = 80x

Now, divide both sides by 80:

x = 1,000 / 80
x = 12.5

So, the width of the lake on the scale drawing is 12.5 cm.

\#\#\#work: To find the width of the lake on the scale drawing, we can use the following proportion: 1 cm / 80 m = x cm / 1,000 m. Cross-multiplying gives 1 * 1,000 = 80 * x, which simplifies to 1,000 = 80x. Dividing both sides by 80 gives x = 1,000 / 80, which simplifies to x = 12.5. So, the width of the lake on the scale drawing is 12.5 cm.
