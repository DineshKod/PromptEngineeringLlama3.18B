0,0,0,12,"Quadrilateral A has side lengths 6, 9, 9, and 12. Quadrilateral B is a scaled copy of Quadrilateral A, with its shortest side of length 2. What is the perimeter of Quadrilateral B?","Please answer this question: Quadrilateral A has side lengths 6, 9, 9, and 12. Quadrilateral B is a scaled copy of Quadrilateral A, with its shortest side of length 2. What is the perimeter of Quadrilateral B?","To find the perimeter of Quadrilateral B, we need to scale down the side lengths of Quadrilateral A by the same factor. Since the shortest side of Quadrilateral B is 2, we can divide each side length of Quadrilateral A by 3 to get the scaled side lengths for Quadrilateral B. 

6/3 = 2
9/3 = 3
9/3 = 3
12/3 = 4

So, the side lengths of Quadrilateral B are 2, 3, 3, and 4. The perimeter of Quadrilateral B is the sum of its side lengths: 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 12.

The perimeter of Quadrilateral B is 12.",12,TRUE,,,

108,108,108,-7,Solve the equation. -5(x-1) = 40,Please answer this question: Solve the equation. -5(x-1) = 40,"To solve the equation -5(x - 1) = 40, follow these steps:

Step 1: Distribute the -5 to both terms inside the parentheses.
-5x + 5 = 40

Step 2: Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation.
-5x = 35

Step 3: Divide both sides of the equation by -5.
x = -7

So, the solution to the equation -5(x - 1) = 40 is x = -7.",-7,TRUE,,,

The reasoning is as follows: There are 3 choices for cap color, 2 choices for clasps, 4 choices for logo locations, and 2 choices for reflective piping (include or not include). So, the total number of outcomes is 3 * 2 * 4 * 2 = 48. However, the question asks for the number of outcomes without writing out the actual options, so we can simplify the answer to 6 (3 * 2 * 2).",48,TRUE,,,
